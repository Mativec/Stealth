+# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
+# front of the TAG it is preceding.
+#
+# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
+# The format is:
+# TAG = value [value, ...]
+# For lists, items can also be appended using:
+# TAG += value [value, ...]
+# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

+#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
+# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
+# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
+# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
